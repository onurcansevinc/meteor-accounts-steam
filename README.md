# Steam OpenID integration for Meteor Accounts

This package provides seamless integration of Meteor accounts system with Steam's OpenID provider.

Tested with **Meteor 2.5.1.** so far.

## Installation

`meteor add 1life1chance:accounts-steam`

## Usage

`Meteor.loginWithSteam(options)`
* `options` - object containing options, see below (optional)

#### Example

```js
Template.myTemplateName.events({
  'click #login-button': function() {
    Meteor.loginWithSteam();
  }
);
```

## Options

These options override service configuration stored in the database.

* `redirectUrl` - where to redirect after successful login

The value below can be only set via Accounts UI dialog or by inserting the service configuration directly to database:

* `timeout` - timeout value (in milliseconds) for the OpenID handshake

## Accounts UI integration

This package integrates with `accounts-ui` and also provides configuration dialog. The configuration dialog contains field `Timeout`, which can be used to adjust timeout value (in milliseconds) for the OpenID handshake.

You can also skip the config dialog by running a short snippet in your `Meteor.startup` function, see below.

**NOTE:** Always choose redirect-based login flow. This package does not support logging in through popup.

## Manual configuration setup

You can manually configure this package by upserting the service configuration on startup. First, add the service configuration package:

`meteor add service-configuration`

Then in your project:

```js
if(Meteor.isServer) {
  Meteor.startup(function () {
    ServiceConfiguration.configurations.upsert(
      { service: 'steam' },
      {
        $set: {
          loginStyle: 'redirect', // THIS MUST BE SET TO REDIRECT
          timeout: 10000          // 10 seconds
        }
      }
    );
  });
}
```

You will most likely want to do this to have your Steam login service always configured.

## Fetching user's profile

This package does not require your Steam API key, because the only information it provides is user's 64 bit Steam ID.

Retrieving user's profile information such as display name or avatar is up to you.

Ideally, you should at least retrieve user's profile information when he logs in for the very first time. This can be accomplished by utilizing [`Accounts.onCreateUser` (server-side)](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/accounts_oncreateuser).

If you wish to keep user's profile up-to-date, you can use [`Accounts.onLogin` (server-side)](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/accounts_onlogin) or different approach.

There are plenty of other account hooks, check out [official Meteor docs](https://docs.meteor.com/).
